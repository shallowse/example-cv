                        persistence in sales. In Elisa I was responsible for the complete selling process from the
                        beginning to the
                        end. I was contacting customers who passed by in shopping malls. I asked them questions to find

                        present my solution which usually solved their problems. After that I closed the deal and made
                        sure that the customer got our product and was happy about it.
